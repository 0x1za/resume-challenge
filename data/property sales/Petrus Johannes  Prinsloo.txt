Candidate Summary
“After completing a one-year course in Personal Training at Exercise Teachers Academy in Stellenbosch, I left South Africa to work as a Personal trainer, Spa Manager and Assistant Manager on some of the world’s largest 5 star cruise ships.
Product and service sales formed an integral part of my day-to-day duties as a Spa Manager, Assistant Manager and personal trainer.
During the time I worked on the cruise ships, I obtained valuable experience in sales techniques while serving clients from various nationalities, and with different needs.
Since my return to South Africa in March 2007, I worked for several marketing and sales companies, and gained valuable knowledge and skills in the marketing and retail business.
In 2010 my attention shifted to property and this is where I found my true passion.
I am a highly self-motivated individual, and a fast learner, who always pursues new ways and techniques to improve my own skills in order to excel in the work I do. I am a firm believer of continuous improvement.
I am a well groomed, outgoing person who loves to work with people, and understand the power of total client satisfaction in order to achieve best revenue income and the generating of profit in the retail environment.
I am proficient in English and Afrikaans. I work well under pressure and always strive to reach or exceed my targets.
Should you be willing to make me part of your company you can be assured of a hardworking, dependable team member with high integrity and the urge to become an invaluable asset to your company.”

While working for Annenberg Property Group, Vodacom approached Dudley Annenberg (Annenberg Property Group Owner) Asking if he could assist in Vodacom's new Fibre Optic Product. Being a broker we know a huge amount of owners and also have the necessary skills to speak to the right person in the shortest time possible. 
The work done consisted of three faces
