Candidate Summary
“I have worked and trained myself to be excellent at the challenges that are placed in my hands.
During my years of employment I have gained a lot of technical experience.  I have gained good knowledge of all types of scales, vacuum- packaging, stretch wrapping, flow packing and air systems, repair of electrical motors and operation of wood work machinery. 
For a period of 5 years I have been maintaining the Lighting Factory.  During this period I also gained sales experience, telephonically inter-acting with various stores, doing in-store merchandizing of the products and maintaining stock levels.  
I started in access control during September 2010 and have gained a lot of experience with security systems.  I understand the importance of access control – the maintenance side of access control and the help desk for customer related problems with access.
I love working with people.  I am administratively inclined; I previously had to schedule client appointments and keep record of my daily calls. I am disciplined and fully understand the functions of a business and the importance of the role that everyone plays. I am technical minded and customer orientated. I am extremely willing to learn and intend to continue with further studies as soon as it is possible to do so to advance and ensure a better future for myself.  I am an asset to any organisation that employs me and always function to my fullest potential and abilities.”
