Cover Letter 
 DM Oberholtzer

With over 25 years in heavy industry, my skills and experience are varied and extensive in both the engineering and production scopes of Mining, Mineral processing and Earth moving machinery.
 Having recently been retrenched from my position as Plant Engineer on a Copper Mine / processing plant in the DRC, I would be immediately available to join and make a positive contribution to any Engineering Department and Operation.
With over 20 years in Heavy Industry Engineering, my experience and skill in coaching and managing engineering teams, departmental functions and projects is extensive.
As a qualified Fitter and Turner, I obtained my NHD and have risen through the ranks over my career. This makes me a hands on Engineer, drawing from experience and years of knowledge performing and managing engineering tasks / teams / departments and projects.

I take ownership and accountability for my plant, am self-motivated, results driven and safety conscious. 
My key focus is on Safety and legal compliance, Plant / equipment availabilities and efficiencies, Budget control (Opex / Capex) and training / skill development of employees.
